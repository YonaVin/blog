I’m a web designer and aspiring front-end developer, exploring the world of coding and UX design. I love creating things that are not only beautiful but also functional. On this blog, I share my experiences of learning web development, my personal journey living abroad, and insights into design, coding, and life in general.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me riding my motorcycle, playing volleyball, or dreaming about future adventures in new countries. I hope my stories and tips can inspire others who are starting their journey into tech or pursuing new passions.
