Hello and welcome!

My name is Alyona, and I’m glad you stopped by my blog. Here, I’ll be sharing my experiences in design and front-end development, talking about the projects I’m working on, and reflecting on my professional growth.

My journey started with design — I worked as a web designer for two years, creating interfaces and visual solutions for different projects. Over time, I realized I wanted to do more than just design: I became curious about how my ideas come to life in code, how users interact with interfaces, and how to improve the experience for everyone using a product.

That’s why I started learning front-end development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was a whole new world — challenging at first, but incredibly exciting. Every small success gave me confidence and motivation to keep going. Now, I can create fully functional websites that are not only beautiful but also user-friendly.

On this blog, I want to share my projects, discoveries, and insights. I hope my posts will be helpful and inspiring to anyone looking to explore web development and design.

Thank you for reading! I’d love to hear your thoughts and questions.
