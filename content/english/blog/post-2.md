# Hello and Welcome!

My name is Alyona, and I'm so glad you stopped by my blog. This is a space where I share my experiences in design and front-end development, talk about the projects I'm working on, and reflect on my growth as a creative professional. Whether you're curious about design, coding, or just enjoy learning from someone's journey, I hope you'll find something interesting here.

## My Journey Begins with Design

I started my career as a web designer, working for two years creating interfaces and visual solutions for a variety of projects. From designing clean and user-friendly layouts to experimenting with color schemes and typography, I quickly realized how much I loved bringing ideas to life visually.

But as much as I loved design, I felt there was more to explore. I wanted to understand how my designs actually work in the real world, how users interact with them, and how to improve their experience. That curiosity pushed me to expand my skillset beyond visuals and dive into the world of coding.

## Discovering Front-End Development

That's when I started learning front-end development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At first, it was a completely new and sometimes intimidating world. Writing code felt like learning a new language, but every small success — seeing a layout come to life, making a button work, or creating a smooth animation — was incredibly rewarding.

Learning to code opened up a new way of thinking for me. I began to see design and development as two sides of the same coin: one creates the vision, the other brings it to life. This combination has allowed me to build websites that are not only visually appealing but also fully functional and user-friendly.

## Projects, Learning, and Growth

On this blog, I'll be sharing not just my projects, but also the lessons I've learned along the way. You'll find case studies, tutorials, tips for improving your skills, and reflections on what it's like to grow in the design and development world.

I hope my experiences can inspire and help anyone who's curious about web design and front-end development. Even small steps in learning and practicing can lead to big progress over time.

## Thank You for Being Here

Thank you for taking the time to read my first post! I'm excited to share this journey with you and would love to hear your thoughts, questions, or even stories about your own path. Let's learn and grow together!
