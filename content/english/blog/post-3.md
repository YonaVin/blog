# Starting My Coding Journey with freeCodeCamp

When I decided to dive into front-end development, I knew I needed a place that could guide me step by step, especially as a complete beginner. That's when I discovered freeCodeCamp — and it turned out to be the perfect choice.

## Why I Chose freeCodeCamp

freeCodeCamp is designed for beginners who want to learn web development from scratch. What I loved about it right away was:

- **Step-by-step learning**: Each lesson builds on the previous one, so you never feel lost.
- **Hands-on practice**: You immediately start coding while learning new concepts.
- **Clear explanations**: Everything is explained in simple language, with examples that make sense.
- **Free and accessible**: You can learn at your own pace, anywhere, anytime.

For someone like me, who was transitioning from design to coding, this structure was exactly what I needed.

## Learning by Doing

The best part of freeCodeCamp is that it's not just theory — it's practice from the very beginning. Every new concept comes with exercises and mini-projects, so you can immediately apply what you've learned.

For example, when I learned HTML and CSS, I didn't just read about tags or styles — I built real web pages right away. This hands-on approach made the learning process exciting and kept me motivated to continue.

## Why It's Ideal for Beginners

If you're new to coding, freeCodeCamp is perfect because:

- It's structured and easy to follow.
- It balances theory with practical exercises.
- You can see your progress in real time.
- It gradually introduces more advanced topics without overwhelming you.

Personally, it made my transition from design to front-end development smooth and enjoyable. I felt confident trying new things and experimenting with code because I had a safe learning environment.

## Moving Forward

Now, after completing several lessons and mini-projects on freeCodeCamp, I feel more confident in HTML, CSS, and even JavaScript basics. I can take what I've learned and start building my own projects, which is incredibly satisfying.

I highly recommend freeCodeCamp to anyone who wants to start coding — especially designers like me who want to bring their ideas to life through code.
