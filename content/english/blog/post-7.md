# My Biggest Mistakes as a Beginner in Design and Front-End (and What I Learned)

When you start learning something new, mistakes are part of the process.
Looking back at my journey from designer to front-end developer, I can see that every mistake taught me something valuable — even when it didn't feel like it at the time.

Here are the biggest lessons I've learned along the way.

## ⚡ 1. Trying to Make Everything Perfect from the Start

When I began designing, I spent hours adjusting tiny details — colors, spacing, or typography — instead of focusing on the bigger picture.
Later, I realized that perfection slows progress.

**What I learned:**
Focus on clarity and functionality first. You can always refine later. Progress matters more than perfection.

## 💻 2. Ignoring Code Early On

As a designer, I didn't pay attention to how things actually work in code. I thought developers would just "make it happen."
But when I started learning front-end, I realized how important it is to understand technical limitations and possibilities.

**What I learned:**
Even basic HTML, CSS, and JS knowledge helps you design smarter and communicate better with developers.

## 🎨 3. Using Too Many Fonts and Colors

At the beginning, I wanted every project to look "creative."
The result? Overcomplicated layouts and inconsistent styles.

**What I learned:**
Good design isn't about adding more — it's about choosing wisely. Simplicity makes design stronger and more professional.

## 📱 4. Forgetting About Mobile Users

I used to design for desktop first — and completely ignored how my designs looked on mobile.
Later, I realized that most users visit websites on their phones.

**What I learned:**
Always design and test for mobile early. Responsive design isn't optional anymore.

## ⏳ 5. Learning Without Practice

I watched tutorials, read articles, and took notes — but didn't build enough real projects.
I was learning in theory, not in action.

**What I learned:**
You only truly learn when you build. Don't wait until you "feel ready" — start creating now.

## 🤯 6. Comparing Myself to Others

It's easy to feel behind when you see amazing portfolios online. I compared my early work to professionals who had years of experience.

**What I learned:**
Everyone has their own pace. Focus on improving your own skills — not competing with others.

## 🌱 Final Thoughts

Mistakes are part of the journey — they're not failures, they're lessons.
Every time you fix something, try again, or discover a better way — that's progress.

If you're just starting out in design or front-end, don't be afraid to make mistakes.
They'll shape you into a stronger, more confident creator.
